I will be creating an SVM program in order to date the era of work by Titian my sample data is found from BU History department and i hope to be able to help with labeling un-dated work using this program. I will break the pictures into sample data testing for facial features, overall brightness, use of bright blue and pink since these colors are commonly used in religious works during the time period, use of nudity since greek myth painting often use nude figures, centrality of portraits, amount of people in each painting,facial expressions and overall size of the paintings. I hope that with these and possibly more data I can create an efficient SVM using matlab and c++ to correctly label unknown paintings.
